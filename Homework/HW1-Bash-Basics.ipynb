    "Usually, you would want to use command line in your terminal to run an R script for a given job/task. Here we are going to leverage the `%%bash` 'magic command' in the jupyter python kernel to execute bash commands in the notebok directly. More information on magic commands can be found in the [documentation of the python kernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html). If you want to call bash commands using the R kernel, you will utilize the [`system`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/system) function in R.\n",

    "For example to execute the `pwd` command in the python kernel, you will use, \n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "system('pwd', intern=TRUE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will **only be using the python kernel**. We are doing this because the syntax for bash is easier and more concise under python than R. We will switch to the R kernel, which you have already installed in the configuration instructions, starting Week 3.\n",

    "7. Make a copy of 'artists.txt' and rename it as 'artists_new.txt'. Move the new copy to a new folder titled 'new_folder' in the 'data' folder, but outside of the 'art' folder.\n",
    "8. Now, create your own script that gives us some information about about the artists.txt file that we didn't know about before or haven't yet tried. Ask a question about the data, then answer it with your script! Utilize the ```sort``` command as part of your script.\n",
    "9. Reflections: On an integer scale of 1-5, 1 being very easy and 5 being the most difficult, where would you rank today's exercises? Be honest! It's okay if you put a 5, and will help us better understand how to make sure your needs are being met. "
