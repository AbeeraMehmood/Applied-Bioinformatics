Code review: Take turns briefly talking through your code and process (3-5 min), then spend the remaining time discussing the different approaches you may have taken to get to the same end-goal. What were the interesting aspects you learned from each other? Share your notes below. Additionally include specific notes on your navigation through the HPC and process of Git. \n",
