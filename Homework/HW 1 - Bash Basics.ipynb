    "Usually, you would want to use command line in your terminal to run an R script for a given job/task. Here we are going to leverage the `%%bash` magic command in the jupyter python kernel to execute bash commands in the notebok directly. More information on mafic commands can be found in the [documentation of the python kernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html). If you want to call bash commands using the R kernel, you will utilize the [`system`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/system) function in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example to execute the `pwd` command in the python kernel, you will use, \n",

    "1. What is the distinction between an absolute vs relative file path? Script an example of these two comparison along with a brief written answer.\n",
    "2. What are 3 ways you can extend the ```ls``` command to give you more information, and what do they give?\n",
    "3. Create a file named 'test.txt', move it into the 'new_folder', then delete the file.\n",
    "4. Create a sorted file artists (alphabetical order) from 'artists.txt' labeled as 'artists_sorted.txt' and place it in the 'new_folder'. Then identify the number of unique artists in that file. \n",
    "5. Use nano in your terminal (not jupyter notebook) to create a bash script titled 'print_names.sh' that echos any name entered in a list of 4 names (3 of the names are fixed, the 4th is not). Move the script to 'new_folder', then run it. Take a screenshot of the input to run the script and output. Briefly explain why you have to do this on terminal, and can't run this on your Jupyter notebook?\n",
    "6. Use nano to create your own script that uses 2 commands we've used and 1 command we haven't yet used (3 total, but you can include more if you'd like) that answers another question you have about the contents of the 'artists.txt' file. Label this script as 'artist_text.sh' and place it in 'new_folder'. Describe what it does, and how. \n",
    "7. Reflections: On an integer scale of 1-5, 1 being very easy and 5 being the most difficult, where would you rank the A1.bb assignment and why? Include some notes about what you gained from this past week that you didn't know before as well as notes of things you already knew. "
